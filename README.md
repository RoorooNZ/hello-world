### a bit about me (on Git)  

I have just started learning about code on the Odin Project, so I am very new at this.  
I hope to perservere through the trials and errors of learning to code so that eventually, one day I can use my new-found skills to design websites and earn an income.  
I'm not sure i'll be any good at this as computers and code and all of this stuff is very much outside of my comfort zone, but I have always enjoyed learning new things and historically, have been a relatively quick learner. You see, I am a plant-girl and tend to enter into the flow state when I am in the garden tending to my plants or creating floral arrangements. Maybe one day, I will enter into the flow state when I am writing code too, only time will tell.
